# 1900-Final-Project

Provide an estimate for the time you expect to spend on different parts of the project, and how you expect the work will be split within your group.

## Plan

We plan to develop a fractal generating interface in C++. We plan to use OpenCV and a GUI for displaying the image/receiving user inputs. We will use Qt creator for installing OpenCV libraries and GUI. Our first two demos are Sierpinski's Triangle and Barnsley's fern. We could use some templates/objects for displaying different images (different parameters in function calls). We could have a class hierarchy for each type of image created using the Iterated Function System. We will also use smart pointers to manage the matrices involved in describing the images.

## Time Breakdown

| Task                                           | Time    | Member          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Configuring GUI                                | 3 hours | Lucas           |
| Installing libraries and setting up Qt creator | 2 hours | Lucas and David |
| Templated function for generating GUI          | 3 hours | David and Lucas |
| Class hierarchy for fractal objects            | 3 hours | David           |
