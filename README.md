# 1900-Final-Project

Write a short proposal (<500 words) describing your project. In particular, describe any libraries or frameworks you plan to use. Talk about what features of C++ you expect to use, and how you plan to structure your project (Does it have a class hierarchy? Is it a series of class templates?). Provide an estimate for the time you expect to spend on different parts of the project, and how you expect the work will be split within your group.

Make a Github repo for your project (it can be either public or private), and add the course staff. Our Github usernames are Grain and yiyunliu. Include the proposal in the Github repo, so we can make comments in a pull request. We can also make a repo for you if you want it to be under the CIS1900 account.

Grading will be based solely on completeness of these requirements. You may need to answer some follow-up questions if your proposal is not detailed enough. One of the course staff will be your project advisor, and they will provide feedback about your proposal as soon as possible.
